# Usage triage - this repo's own packs

The corpus that reaches a session is placed on the promotion ladder by judgment at
authoring time. The usage review reads back whether the placement held, and hands
you the findings that have lasted. Your job is to turn one into a change the owner
can read as a diff.

Load [triaging-usage-findings](../../skills/triaging-usage-findings/SKILL.md) and
follow it. It owns the order: the element's provenance file first, then the rule's
causes worked in order, then the edit - and no edit at all where no cause is
settled.

## Scope

`.claudinite/local/packs/` - this repo's own packs, and nothing else. A finding
about a subject that arrived from a canon is not this repo's to change: it belongs
to whoever maintains that shelf, and the review's file is the evidence they read.
Leave it, and say so in the run's summary.

The Context section is binding scope: propose about the subjects it names, and do
not re-derive which findings count. The review's file,
`.claudinite/usage/element-review-findings.json`, carries each finding's figures,
and its possible causes.

Never merge what you open, and file no issue. Where you settle no cause, say in the
run's summary what you read and what would settle it, and open nothing for it.

Deliver the pull request as your instructions say to deliver a pull request.
Its body names the cause you settled on and what settled it, the provenance fields
you read, the window the finding was written from, and the finding's rule and subject.

# basics pack

The baseline pack — the `RULES.md` prose every session loads (injected by the pack-prose hook) plus the working-discipline checks. Its subject is **how work is done**, whatever tool is running it. Declared explicitly like every other pack — no pack is active by default; bootstrap seeds the declaration and the nightly baselining backfills it into existing consumers.

Two rules are skills the guard forces for the files they concern: writing a check that scans the
repo ([`writing-repo-scanning-checks`](skills/writing-repo-scanning-checks/SKILL.md), for any coded
or declared check) and editing a `GENERATED` file
([`working-with-generated-files`](skills/working-with-generated-files/SKILL.md)). Three more load on
a tool call or its result rather than a path: [`committing`](skills/committing/SKILL.md),
[`fetching-from-the-web`](skills/fetching-from-the-web/SKILL.md) and
[`searching-for-a-tool`](skills/searching-for-a-tool/SKILL.md).

## Checks

The working-discipline rules with a deterministic signature. The world rules read repo state; the four work rules judge the change and the session in front of you.

`barrier` is the one check a project has to configure before it does anything: it enforces a
**directed folder-access graph** the repo declares on this pack's entry as `config.barriers.rules`,
and a repo that declares none is silent rather than failing. [barriers.md](barriers.md) is the whole
vocabulary — the rule forms, how a reference is resolved against the tree, the exception kinds, and
how another pack ships a fixed barrier of its own as manifest data. It arrived here when the
`barriers` pack was absorbed (#1681): no project ever chose that pack, it rode in on the baseline's
`requires` closure, and a separate identity for a mechanism everyone already has bought only a
second catalog row and an adoption question nobody had asked for.

`improve-comments-scope` is owned by the
[improve-comments](skills/improve-comments/checks.mjs) skill rather than by this pack's rule
directories, because it validates that skill's action rather than a property of the repo: on a
branch whose commit subject is `Claudinite tidy: improve comments` it strips the comments from both
sides of every changed file and reds anything left over, plus any change at all under
`.claudinite/` — the mount is not the repo's own source. Silent everywhere else, so an ordinary
branch pays nothing for it. The [improve-comments](tasks/improve-comments/README.md) task is what
writes under it, weekly, over the files the window's commits touched. Both arrived here when the
`tidy-repo` pack was retired (#1839): its issue and PR sweeps had been outgrown, and the comment
pass was the one dimension left — baseline housekeeping, with no second declaration to earn.

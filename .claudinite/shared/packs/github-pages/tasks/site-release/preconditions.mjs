// The release's gate: has the default branch moved since the last release went out?
//
// This is the task's own term because no built-in asks the question a release asks.
// `substantive-change` excludes task-authored commits, so a recount another task
// landed — a real change to what the site serves — would read as silence and never
// ship. `any-commit` includes them but measures a WINDOW, so the release's own bump
// commit keeps the window non-empty and every night re-releases the same bytes under
// a fresh version number.
//
// What ends that loop is position, not membership: the newest release commit is a
// high-water mark, and only what sits above it is unreleased. That is the same guard
// `[skip ci]` used to be, stated as a fact about the branch rather than as a flag on
// a commit message — nothing can accidentally re-arm a release by rewording a commit.
//
// A repo that does not declare public-website has no version to advance, so its
// release commits nothing and leaves no mark. The gate then degrades to "any commit
// in the window": a change is deployed on the night it lands and, at most, once more
// on the following night — a redundant redeploy of identical bytes, never a missed
// one.

// Which commits are the release's own, read structurally off the `Claudinite-Task:`
// trailer every task-authored commit carries. The worker stamps it from the queue's
// own `CLAUDINITE_PACK`/`CLAUDINITE_TASK`; the test holds this literal against the
// two directory names those are derived from.

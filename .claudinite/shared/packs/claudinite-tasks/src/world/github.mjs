// THE GITHUB PORT. Every REST path this pack calls is spelled in this module and
// nowhere else: a caller names the OPERATION it wants — read this issue, swap this
// label, merge this pull request — and never the URL that performs it. That is
// what makes the outward edge countable and replaceable; a module that spelled its
// own path would be a second GitHub client nothing knows about.
//
// The transport is `gh(path) -> { status, json }`, made by `makeGh` and passed to
// every operation as its first argument. It stays an injected function rather than
// a bound client because the whole pack tests against a fake `gh`, and because the
// fleet planner supplies its own reader over a different token.
//
// A non-2xx returns `{ status, json: null }` rather than throwing, so a 404 (no
// release yet, missing file) is data, not an error. Callers that must not mistake
// a refusal for an answer read the STATUS — a 403 from a repo whose Actions cannot
// write puts a plausible object where the result should be.
//
// LABEL WRITES ARE GRANULAR, ALWAYS (docs/PRINCIPLES.md): add and remove NAMED
// labels (POST/DELETE), never write the label SET (PUT). A set-write replaces from
// a stale snapshot and clobbers concurrent transitions — a bug class GitHub's own
// CLI shipped (cli/cli#4861) — and with a scheduler run and several executors all
// moving labels at once, that is a correctness rule rather than a style preference.

//
// Process-wide because a run IS a process — the scheduler and the executor each get
// a fresh one — and the cost record the run prints is about that process. A request
// that failed still counts: it was made, it was billed against the rate limit, and
// a run that spent its budget on refusals spent it.

// Executor-side deterministic validation of a dispatch issue, BEFORE any model
// judgment (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §5.2). Given the issue body, it asserts
// in code that the first line is a legal task path, the task file exists at HEAD,
// its pack is declared, and its `task.mjs` sibling parses to a well-formed
// declaration — then resolves the model and outcome ceiling the executor will
// enforce. An invalid dispatch is rejected (the executor de-labels it and
// converges it to needs-human), so a forged or mangled issue never runs.
//
// Pure over injected capabilities so it unit-tests without a repo or GitHub. It
// is NOT a CLI — the executor shell beside it, `resolve-dispatch.mjs`, is what
// drives it in production: that shell takes the issue body out of the label
// event's payload on disk and wires `exists`/`isPackDeclared`/`loadTask` to the
// checkout, so validating a dispatch costs no GitHub call at all.

// segment under a packs/ root. The `.claudinite/(shared|local)/` prefix is
// OPTIONAL: a consumer's task path carries it (its canon is mounted at
// `.claudinite/shared/packs/`, its own packs at `.claudinite/local/packs/`),
// while the CANON repo runs its own tree and dispatches root-relative paths
// (`packs/<pack>/…` for its canon packs, `.claudinite/local/packs/<pack>/…` for
// its local packs). All three forms are legal; nothing else is.

# Skills mounted here, and what loads each one

A skill loads when the session's activity matches its description. A skill that names files
under `force-load-on-file-edits-paths` is also forced for them: a file tool aimed there is held
by the PreToolUse guard until the skill is loaded (the Skill tool, or a Read of its SKILL.md),
and an edit made another way is caught at Stop.

## Before editing these files

| Files | Skill | Pack | Loads when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `**/CLAUDE.md`, `**/.claude/rules/**` | `authoring-agent-docs` | basics | How to write instruction files coding agents follow reliably. Use before writing or editing any Claude instruction doc — a project CLAUDE.md, a convention doc, a routine spec. |
| `**/packs/*/RULES.md`, `**/packs/*/skills/**`, `**/packs/*/worldRules/**`, `**/packs/*/workRules/**`, `**/packs/*/declared-checks.json`, `**/packs/*/tasks/**`, `**/packs/*/pack.mjs`, `**/packs/*/README.md`, `**/packs/*/provenance/**` | `changing-pack-elements` | claudinite-growth | What a change to a pack's element owes: the provenance entry, its kind, what a README carries. Loaded for any edit of a pack's rules, skills, checks, tasks or manifest. |
| `**/*GENERATED*` | `working-with-generated-files` | basics | Working with a generated file: naming it, changing the generator rather than the file, resolving conflicts by regenerating. Loaded for any edit of a GENERATED file. |
| `docs/**/DESIGN.md` | `writing-migration-plans` | basics | How a plan's phases are ordered so nothing stalls mid-run. Use before writing any DESIGN.md, migration, rollout or phased plan, or when working through a plan's tracking issue. |
| `**/packs/*/RULES.md`, `**/packs/*/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `writing-pack-prose` | claudinite-growth | How pack prose is written: brevity, structure, triggerability, the provenance marker. Loaded for any edit of a pack's RULES.md or SKILL.md, and when landing a lesson as prose. |
| `**/engine/checks/**`, `**/packs/*/worldRules/**`, `**/packs/*/workRules/**`, `**/packs/*/skills/*/checks.mjs`, `**/declared-checks.json` | `writing-repo-scanning-checks` | basics | How a repo-scanning check picks its files, strips comments, and proves itself silent on real sources. Loaded for any edit of a coded or declared check. |
| `**/tasks/**` | `writing-tasks` | claudinite-growth | The contract a Claudinite task is written to. Use when writing or changing a tasks/<name>/task.json or its worker, or when a task-declaration check fires. |
| `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`, `**/*_test.*`, `**/test_*.*`, `**/test/**`, `**/tests/**`, `**/__tests__/**`, `**/spec/**` | `writing-tests` | basics | Practices for writing tests you can trust. Use before writing or changing any test — see-it-fail discipline, snapshot/golden rules, CI-only and heavy-browser tests, fuzzy-metric gating. |

## By activity

| Skill | Pack | Loads when |
|---|---|---|
| `adopt-claudinite` | claudinite-lifecycle | Bootstrap Claudinite into a repo: mount, hooks, checks, skills. Use when asked to adopt or set up Claudinite, or to re-vendor a repo's mount. |
| `adopt-pack` | claudinite-lifecycle | Add packs to a repo already running Claudinite: declare, interview, re-vendor, scaffold, land. Use when asked to adopt, add, enable or declare a pack. |
| `backfilling-provenance` | claudinite-growth | Filling a pack's empty provenance files from its history. Use when a pack carries empty provenance files, or when asked to backfill a pack's provenance. |
| `bug-investigation` | basics | Pinning down a bug's root cause. Use when investigating a bug report, when a fix didn't hold or a bug recurs, or when a report doesn't reproduce. |
| `ci-performance-evaluation` | basics | Finding where a repo's CI time goes and what is worth fixing. Use when CI feels slow, on a runtime regression, or on a ci-performance finding. |
| `committing` | basics | How a commit is cut: one concern per commit, the issue it references, files staged by name. Use before any git commit. |
| `do-later` | basics | File a change to be made after the work in flight, as an issue queued behind it. Use on "/do-later …", "do this after this lands", or any deferred change. |
| `extract-from-activity` | claudinite-growth | Mine a window of a repo's commits, merged PRs and issues for durable lessons and land them in its local packs. Use when asked what recent work taught. |
| `extract-from-conversations` | claudinite-growth | Mine an agent-user conversation for friction-driven lessons and land them in the repo's local packs. Use on a session transcript or conversation log, or when asked for a retrospective. |
| `extract-from-instructions` | claudinite-growth | Convert instruction prose somebody already wrote into pack carriers. Use when adopting Claudinite on a repo with a CLAUDE.md, or when asked to convert instruction prose into a pack. |
| `fetching-from-the-web` | basics | Reading a page or file from the web: exact bytes over a summary, and what a 403 or egress block means. Use before any WebFetch or curl. |
| `file-placement` | basics | Where a file should live: the reference-distance metric and its exemptions. Use before placing, moving or renaming a file, or when reviewing where one lives. |
| `growth-dedup` | claudinite-growth | Prune a repo's local packs of items the mounted canon now covers. Use when asked to reconcile or dedup local packs against the canon. |
| `improve-comments` | basics | Improve a repo's own comments as a pass of their own: delete, correct, add the why. Never as a side effect of another change. |
| `learning-a-technology` | claudinite-growth | Teach a repo a technology nobody there has used yet. Use when asked to host, send or publish through something new, or to research it and create a skill. |
| `paper-intake` | vascular-coloring | Take a research paper PDF into references/ — folder, digest, extracted figures, cropped panels, calibration, synthesis. Use whenever a new article is added to this repo, or an existing one needs re-processing. |
| `production-retrospective` | basics | Design and file the review that comes back once a larger element has lived in production. Use when designing such an element, or when its merge completes it. |
| `prose-to-checks` | claudinite-growth | Mine pack prose for always-testable rules never converted to checks, and convert the strongest. Use when auditing packs for convertible rules, or over prose a growth run just wrote. |
| `repo-text-sweeps` | basics | Mechanics for grep/sed sweeps, renames, and path relocations across a repo. Use before a bulk find-replace, a rename, or moving files — and after one, to catch silently broken references. |
| `revalidating-rules` | claudinite-growth | Re-probe pack rules whose truth lives outside the repository and correct the stale ones. Use on a revalidation sweep, or when asked whether a rule's environmental claim still holds. |
| `searching-for-a-tool` | basics | Finding a harness tool by name — the select form for a deferred tool, and what an empty search means. Use before any ToolSearch, and when a search finds nothing. |
| `triaging-usage-findings` | claudinite-growth | Turn a lasting usage-review finding into a proposed change, written as the edit itself. Use on a usage-triage run, or when asked what to do about a finding. |
| `unattended-agents` | claudinite-growth | Architecture and practices for unattended, automation-invoked agents and recurring routines. Use when building, structuring, or running an AI agent, a scheduled routine, or a multi-stage agent pipeline. |
| `verify-in-production` | basics | Decide whether a merged change can only be proven in production, and if so file the verification that comes back on its own. Use right after the merge. |
| `vessel-overlay-review` | vascular-coloring | Show a vessel-extraction result as an annotated overlay on the original panel and state explicit visual assertions about it. Use whenever proposing, revising, or reporting on the segmentation/measurement pipeline in this repo — before quoting any new numbers. |
| `writing-handover-issues` | basics | How to write a task list a person will execute. Use when filing or editing an issue that asks a human to click, set, register or copy something. |

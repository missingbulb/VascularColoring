# Skills mounted here, and what loads each one

A skill loads when the session's activity matches its description. A skill that names files
under `force-load-on-file-edits-paths` is also forced for them: a file tool aimed there is held
by the PreToolUse guard until the skill is loaded (the Skill tool, or a Read of its SKILL.md),
and an edit made another way is caught at Stop.

## Before editing these files

| Files | Skill | Pack | Loads when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `**/CLAUDE.md`, `**/.claude/rules/**` | `authoring-agent-docs` | basics | How to write instruction files coding agents follow reliably. Use before writing or editing any Claude instruction doc — a project CLAUDE.md, a convention doc, a routine spec. |
| `**/packs/*/RULES.md`, `**/packs/*/skills/**`, `**/packs/*/worldRules/**`, `**/packs/*/workRules/**`, `**/packs/*/declared-checks.json`, `**/packs/*/tasks/**`, `**/packs/*/pack.json`, `**/packs/*/pack.mjs`, `**/packs/*/README.md`, `**/packs/*/provenance/**` | `changing-pack-elements` | claudinite-growth | What a change to a pack's element owes: the provenance entry, its kind, what a README carries. Loaded for any edit of a pack's rules, skills, checks, tasks or manifest. |
| `.github/site.config`, `.github/workflows/github-pages-*.yml`, `**/tasks/site-release/**` | `github-pages-pipeline` | github-pages | Wiring, operating or debugging a site repo's GitHub Pages release. Use when setting one up, when a site-config or deploy-workflow check fires, when a release parks, or to deploy now. |
| `**/*GENERATED*` | `working-with-generated-files` | basics | Working with a generated file: naming it, changing the generator rather than the file, resolving conflicts by regenerating. Loaded for any edit of a GENERATED file. |
| `**/packs/*/RULES.md`, `**/packs/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `**/packs/*/pack.json`, `**/packs/*/pack.mjs` | `writing-pack-prose` | claudinite-growth | How pack prose is written: brevity, structure, triggerability, the provenance marker, a pack's pitch. Loaded for any edit of a pack's RULES.md, SKILL.md or manifest, and when landing a lesson as prose. |
| `**/engine/checks/**`, `**/packs/*/worldRules/**`, `**/packs/*/workRules/**`, `**/packs/*/skills/*/checks.mjs`, `**/declared-checks.json` | `writing-repo-scanning-checks` | basics | How a repo-scanning check picks its files, strips comments, and proves itself silent on real sources. Loaded for any edit of a coded or declared check. |
| `**/tasks/**` | `writing-tasks` | claudinite-growth | The contract a Claudinite task is written to. Use when writing or changing a tasks/<name>/task.json or its worker, or when a task-declaration check fires. |
| `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`, `**/*_test.*`, `**/test_*.*`, `**/test/**`, `**/tests/**`, `**/__tests__/**`, `**/spec/**` | `writing-tests` | basics | Practices for writing tests you can trust. Use before writing or changing any test — see-it-fail discipline, snapshot/golden rules, CI-only and heavy-browser tests, fuzzy-metric gating. |

## By activity

| Skill | Pack | Loads when |
|---|---|---|
| `adopt-claudinite` | claudinite-lifecycle | Bootstrap Claudinite into a repo with cn init: packs, questions, workflows, the executor routine, the handover issue. Use when asked to adopt or set up Claudinite. |
| `adopt-pack` | claudinite-lifecycle | Add packs to a repo already running Claudinite: declare, interview, re-vendor, scaffold, land. Use when asked to adopt, add, enable or declare a pack. |
| `backfilling-provenance` | claudinite-growth | Filling a pack's empty provenance files from its history. Use when a pack carries empty provenance files, or when asked to backfill a pack's provenance. |
| `bug-investigation` | basics | Pinning down a bug's root cause. Use when investigating a bug report, when a fix didn't hold or a bug recurs, or when a report doesn't reproduce. |
| `ci-performance-evaluation` | basics | Finding where a repo's CI time goes and what is worth fixing. Use when CI feels slow, on a runtime regression, or on a ci-performance finding. |
| `committing` | basics | How a commit is cut: one concern per commit, the issue it references, files staged by name. Use before any git commit. |
| `extract-from-activity` | claudinite-growth | Mine a window of a repo's commits, merged PRs and issues for durable lessons and land them in its local packs. Use when asked what recent work taught. |
| `extract-from-conversations` | claudinite-growth | Mine an agent-user conversation for friction-driven lessons and land them in the repo's local packs. Use on a session transcript or conversation log, or when asked for a retrospective. |
| `extract-from-instructions` | claudinite-growth | Convert instruction prose somebody already wrote into pack carriers. Use when adopting Claudinite on a repo with a CLAUDE.md, or when asked to convert instruction prose into a pack. |
| `fetching-from-the-web` | basics | Reading a page or file from the web: exact bytes over a summary, and what a 403 or egress block means. Use before any WebFetch or curl. |
| `file-placement` | basics | Where a file should live: the reference-distance metric and its exemptions. Use before placing, moving or renaming a file, or when reviewing where one lives. |
| `git-github-advanced` | git-github | Git/GitHub procedures beyond the basics task lifecycle. Use for commit layering, recovering a branch after a squash-merge, CI-trigger rules, GitHub Actions gotchas, or merge-relocation traps. |
| `github-actions-scheduling` | git-github | What a GitHub Actions `schedule:` trigger actually guarantees. Use when adding, changing, explaining or debugging anything that runs on a cron in GitHub Actions. |
| `growth-dedup` | claudinite-growth | Prune a repo's local packs of items the mounted canon now covers. Use when asked to reconcile or dedup local packs against the canon. |
| `image-algorithm-development` | vascular-coloring | State-by-state procedure for developing an image detection, segmentation or reading algorithm with an owner validating - which of the inputs, the approved render, the answer key and the grader exists yet, what to build next, what to ask and when to stop. Use when starting, resuming or iterating on any such algorithm, from microscope channels to phone photos. |
| `improve-comments` | basics | Improve a repo's own comments as a pass of their own: delete, correct, add the why. Never as a side effect of another change. |
| `learning-a-technology` | claudinite-growth | Teach a repo a technology nobody there has used yet. Use when asked to host, send or publish through something new, or to research it and create a skill. |
| `merge-to-main` | git-github | Merge the change in front of the owner into main. Use when the owner approves the current branch or PR, or asks to merge or land it into main. |
| `paper-intake` | vascular-coloring | Take a research paper PDF into references/. Use whenever a new article is added to this repo, or an existing one needs re-processing. |
| `production-retrospective` | basics | Design and file the review that comes back once a larger element has lived in production. Use when designing such an element, or when its merge completes it. |
| `prose-to-checks` | claudinite-growth | Mine pack prose for always-testable rules never converted to checks, and convert the strongest. Use when auditing packs for convertible rules, or over prose a growth run just wrote. |
| `repo-text-sweeps` | basics | Mechanics for grep/sed sweeps, renames, and path relocations across a repo. Use before a bulk find-replace, a rename, or moving files — and after one, to catch silently broken references. |
| `revalidating-rules` | claudinite-growth | Re-probe pack rules whose truth lives outside the repository and correct the stale ones. Use on a revalidation sweep, or when asked whether a rule's environmental claim still holds. |
| `searching-for-a-tool` | basics | Finding a harness tool by name — the select form for a deferred tool, and what an empty search means. Use before any ToolSearch, and when a search finds nothing. |
| `triaging-usage-findings` | claudinite-growth | Turn a lasting usage-review finding into a proposed change, written as the edit itself. Use on a usage-triage run, or when asked what to do about a finding. |
| `unattended-agents` | claudinite-growth | Architecture and practices for unattended, automation-invoked agents and recurring routines. Use when building, structuring, or running an AI agent, a scheduled routine, or a multi-stage agent pipeline. |
| `vessel-overlay-review` | vascular-coloring | Show extraction results as an annotated overlay with explicit visual assertions. Use whenever proposing, revising, or reporting on the segmentation/measurement pipeline in this repo — before quoting numbers. |
| `writing-handover-issues` | basics | How to write a task list a person will execute. Use when filing or editing an issue that asks a human to click, set, register or copy something. |

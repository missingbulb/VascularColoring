- **One-line thesis:** spatial transcriptomics + region-resolved endothelial scRNA-seq across
  postnatal mouse brain show that **cortex and thalamus run different angiogenic programs on
  different schedules**; neuronal→endothelial **TGFβ2** signalling drives thalamic vascularization
  in a defined postnatal window, and losing endothelial **TGFβR1** causes **mTOR hyperactivation,
  thalamus-predominant vascular malformations and haemorrhage** — rescued by mTOR inhibition.

## 1. Why this matters to *our* task

This is predominantly an **omics** paper; the imaging is supporting evidence. It contributes
**no panels to the working dataset** (§5). Three things are worth having:

1. **A whole-brain vascular-density heatmap, computed the way Rust 2020 does it but at brain
   scale.** Segment the vasculature, tile the image into fixed-size squares, compute density per
   square, colour-map. Rust argues for this as a *visualization*; Bizou uses it as the primary
   measurement across seven brain regions and five ages. Two independent papers converging on the
   same construct is a good argument for adding it — and it directly answers the
   *where is tissue under-vascularized* question that the ischemic-core/penumbra work is about.
2. **An open-source segmentation-analysis package** — the **LIOM Toolkit**
   (<https://github.com/LIOMLab/liom-toolkit>), Python + scikit-image, the same stack as our
   pipeline. A second implementation to read alongside Pyvane.
3. **A caution about regional heterogeneity.** Vascular density differs *significantly by brain
   region at the same age* — thalamus consistently highest from P6 to P40. Any "normal cortex"
   baseline number is region-specific. Our own panels are all cortex, which is fortunate, but it
   is a reason not to compare our numbers to a whole-brain literature value.

**Note on the vascular-density unit:** this paper reports **µm²/mm² × 10³** — an *area* density
(our `area%` rescaled), not the length density (mm/mm²) that Rust and Freitas-Andrade use. Do not
mix the two.

## 2. Vessel segmentation and analysis (the transferable part)

- **Labelling:** antibodies against **CD31 and ICAM2**; the two channels are **merged to improve
  signal-to-noise** before segmentation. (A neat trick, and an argument that our single-channel
  inputs are working with less information than the field typically does.)
- **Imaging:** Leica **DMi8** inverted microscope for the vascular sections; Leica **TCS SP8**
  confocal at **63×** for the RNAscope/high-magnification work; **Zeiss Axioscan Z1** slide
  scanner for Visium H&E.
- **Segmentation:** **Imaris 9.9.1**, `Surfaces` module on the merged CD31/ICAM2 channel, with
  **surface detail = 1 µm** and **background subtraction = 3 µm**. **Pixel classification** was
  then trained to predict and reject false-positive vessels.
- **Downstream analysis:** Python + **scikit-image**, published as the **LIOM Toolkit**
  segmentation module.
- **Heatmap:** the segmented image is divided into **fixed-size squares**; vascular density is
  computed per square and rendered as a heatmap over the coronal section.
- **Other quantifications:** ERG⁺ endothelial nuclei per mm² of tissue; ERG⁺EdU⁺/ERG⁺ for
  proliferation; **tip cells per mm² of vessel**, identified as having **CD31⁺/ICAM2⁻ filopodia**
  — a nice example of using a two-marker mismatch to identify a structure neither marker
  identifies alone.
- **Stats:** one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's or Tukey's multiple comparisons, Kruskal–Wallis with
  Dunn's, Brown-Forsythe/Welch ANOVA with Dunnett's T3; all two-sided; mean ± s.e.m.

## 3. Results

1. **Regional vascularization dynamics (Fig 1).** Vascular density (CD31/ICAM2) mapped across
   **7 regions** — cortex (CTX), hippocampal formation (HPF), thalamus (THAL), hypothalamus (HY),
   piriform (PIR), caudoputamen (CP), amygdala (AMG) — at **P1, P6, P12, P21, P40**
   (n = 3 per age; n = 5 at P40). Density rises from birth to ~P20 in **all** regions, but
   **thalamus is significantly the densest from P6 through P40** (P6 p=0.031, P12 p=0.0066,
   P20 p=0.0006, P40 p=0.0047 vs the whole-brain mean). ERG⁺ endothelial cells and **tip cells**
   (CD31⁺/ICAM2⁻ filopodia) peak at **P6** and differ significantly between cortex and thalamus.
2. **Endothelial heterogeneity (Fig 2).** Region-resolved scRNA-seq of cortical and thalamic ECs
   at P6, P12 and adult resolves arterial, venous, capillary, proliferative and **tip-cell**
   clusters (tip markers *Chst1*, *Apod*). Proliferative and tip clusters exist at both early
   stages; angiogenic and BBB/transporter pathway activity diverges between the two regions.
3. **Spatial profiling (Fig 3).** Visium spatial transcriptomics at P6, P12 and adult
   (n = 2 per age) tracks synaptic remodelling and glial differentiation (*Mbp*, *Gfap* up;
   *Tubb2b* down, *Rora* up) alongside region-specific angiogenic expression landscapes.
4. **NVU communications (Fig 4).** Ligand–receptor analysis ranks **VEGFA** top overall;
   **TGFβ2** signalling from neurons to endothelium is specific to thalamus at **P6–P12**,
   validated spatially by Visium, ISH and the Allen atlas.
5. **TGFβ is required (Fig 5).** Endothelial *Tgfbr1* knockout disrupts postnatal angiogenesis
   and vascular maturation.
6. **mTOR is the mechanism (Fig 6).** Loss of endothelial TGFβR1 → **mTOR hyperactivation**
   (strong phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP1) → thalamus-predominant vascular malformations and
   haemorrhage; **mTORC1 inhibition rescues** the phenotype.

## 4. Limitations / gaps for us

- **No pixel size, no scale bar** identifiable on the extracted figures; nothing to calibrate.
- Segmentation depends on **Imaris**, commercial software — the exact step we cannot reproduce.
  Only the *downstream* analysis (LIOM Toolkit) is open.
- **Heatmap square size is not stated** — the same parameter Rust 2020 also leaves to the user.
- The vascular measurements are supporting evidence for a molecular story; the paper does not
  report branch counts, lengths or tortuosity.

## 5. Extracted images — and why there is no `panels/` folder here

All six figures are extracted and described in [`figures/README.md`](figures/README.md).

**No panel from this paper enters the working dataset.** The micrographs are all
**multi-channel merges** — vessels in yellow with DAPI nuclei in blue and often EdU or a third
marker in white/red — so none is an isolated vessel channel, and the DAPI speckle would be
measured as texture by any thresholding pipeline. The rest of the figures are heatmaps, UMAPs,
PCA plots and expression heatmaps. With no stated pixel size there is nothing to calibrate
either.

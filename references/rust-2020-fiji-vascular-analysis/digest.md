## 1. Why this matters to *our* task ⭐

This is the **methods reference** for the project, in a way Wang 2022 is not. Wang gave us the
images and the biology but only published intensity and area-%; Rust gives us **exactly the
quantification we are building**, from an established lab, with the parameter set named and
defended.

Three concrete payoffs:

| What we get | Where it lands in our repo |
|---|---|
| **An external, published definition of our metrics** — area fraction, length (mm/mm²), branch count (per mm²), nearest-neighbour distance. Our locked COUNT/CATEGORIZE/MEASURE trio maps onto it almost exactly. | [`analysis/WORKING-GUIDE.md`](../../analysis/WORKING-GUIDE.md) §4, [`../METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md`](../METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md) |
| **Real reference magnitudes** to sanity-check against (§4) — adult mouse cortex ≈ 0.10 area fraction, ≈ 25 mm/mm² length density, ≈ 310 branches/mm², ≈ 24 µm nearest distance. | [`analysis/results-first-pass.md`](../../analysis/results-first-pass.md) |
| **The complete Fiji macro, a µm-calibrated native-resolution vessel image, and the LUT** (§7) — which together let us run their exact method against ours on their own data. **We match it to within 5–16%.** | [`supplementary/`](supplementary/), [`../METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md`](../METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md) §3 |
| **A fifth metric we do not yet compute — nearest-neighbour distance** — which the authors argue catches local hypoxic gaps that mean density hides. Cheap to add on top of our existing mask. | candidate next step |

**The one thing it does *not* give us:** Rust deliberately does **not** distinguish vessel types
("we did not intent to distinguish between different types of blood vessels (such as arteries,
arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins)"). Our **CATEGORIZE** ask has no counterpart here —
that stays our own contribution, and Wang's phalloidin / α-SMA panels remain the only external
check on it.

## 2. The pipeline, step by step (Figure 1C) ⭐

This is the paper's core content and it is only printed **as an image** — reproduced here in
full so the PDF never has to be reopened. Figure: [`figures/fig1_pipeline_development.png`](figures/fig1_pipeline_development.png).

| Stage | Steps as printed |
|---|---|
| **Raw image** | tiff-format · select ROI |
| **Pre-processing** | 8/16-bit · Median filter · Binarization · Skeletonization · Batch-processing |
| **Analysis** | Area fraction · Vessel length · Vessel branching · Nearest neighbor |
| **Visualization** | Heatmaps · Plots |

And how each number is actually computed (Methods, *Microscopy and Vascular and Pericyte
Quantification*):

- **Duplicate → denoise → binarize.** The image is duplicated, processed to remove noise, and
  binarized. The main text states no radius or threshold; **the supplementary macro does —
  median radius 1, `setThreshold(66, 255)` on 8-bit. See §7.1.**
- **Area fraction** = "the percentage of pixels with non-zero pixels" in the binary image.
  *(= our `area%`.)*
- **Vessel segment length** and **vascular branching**: **skeletonize the binary image**, then
  "tag all pixels in a skeleton image and then count all its branches and measure their average
  and maximum length". *(= our `segments` and `length_um`; they report mean/max per branch, we
  report the total.)*
- **Distance between single vessels** = **nearest-neighbour distance** between "closest
  individual single non-zero pixels". *(We do not compute this yet.)*
- **Pericyte coverage** = pericyte area fraction ÷ vascular area fraction. *(Needs a second
  channel; not applicable to our single-channel panels.)*
- **Heatmap** = divide the field into an N×N grid of squares, compute the area fraction of each
  square, colour-map the values. Square size is a parameter, "adjustable and should be adapted
  to the used magnification and sample".

### Required Fiji plugins (only two)
- **Measure Skeleton Length** — vessel segment length.
- **Nearest Neighbor Distances Calculation with ImageJ** — the distance metric.

The script itself is **Supplementary Data Sheet 1** — **now in this repo**, transcribed and
analysed in **§7**.

### How this compares to what we already do

| Step | Rust 2020 | Our `measure_vessels.py` |
|---|---|---|
| Denoise | median filter, **radius 1** | Gaussian σ=1.0 |
| Binarize | **manual `setThreshold(66,255)`** on 8-bit | red-dominance + Otsu with a floor, OR'd with a Frangi vesselness ridge filter |
| Gap handling | not mentioned | binary closing (disk 2) + fill holes |
| Skeleton | Fiji Skeletonize | `skimage.skeletonize` + spur pruning |
| Branch count | Analyze Skeleton | connected components of skeleton minus junctions |
| Length | mean + max per branch | total centerline length |
| Distance | nearest-neighbour | **not implemented** |
| Vessel type | **not attempted** | capillary vs artery by centerline diameter |

Our segmentation is *more* aggressive than theirs (Frangi + red-dominance vs a plain manual
threshold), which is the right call for figure-resolution crops. **§7.4 settles what that costs:
on their own native image we find 16% less area and 5% less length than their recipe — a small
under-detection, not a different answer.**

## 3. Experimental design at a glance

- **Mice:** wildtype and **Claudin5-eGFP (Cldn5-GFP)** C57BL/6, 7 days to 3 months, both sexes.
- **Four ways to make vessels visible** (all shown to work with the pipeline — Fig 1B):
  1. **Immunohistology** — rat anti-**CD31**, BD Biosciences, 1:100.
  2. **Isolectin B4** — lectin histofluorescence.
  3. **Transcardial perfusion** with **Lectin-DyLight594** (50 µl of 1 mg/ml, injected 1 min
     before perfusion).
  4. **Cldn5-eGFP reporter mice** — genetic label.
  > **Caveat the authors flag:** perfusion labels only vessels that carry blood, so **newly
  > formed vessels, tip cells and filopodia are missed**. Best signal-to-noise came from
  > transgenic reporters and perfusion.
- **Mouse tissue:** 4% PFA perfusion, post-fix 4 h, 30% sucrose, **40 µm coronal sections**
  (sliding microtome), free-floating; DAPI counterstain; Mowiol.
- **Stroke model:** **photothrombotic** (not MCAO) — Rose Bengal 13 mg/kg i.p., cold light
  through intact skull for **8 min** over a 5 × 3 mm window at Bregma +2.5 to −2.5 mm.
  **Analysis 3 weeks post-stroke** (also validated at days 1, 3, 7, 28).
- **Regions defined:** **stroke core** (no surviving neurons), **ischemic border zone (ibz)** =
  a band **300 µm distal to the core** with hypovascularization, **intact** = contralesional
  cortex.
- **Human tissue:** paraffin, **5 µm** sections of medial frontal cortex, Netherlands Brain
  Bank; **5 AD patients vs 5 age-matched controls** (all AD subjects female, APOE E4 carriers,
  Braak 5–6). Labels: **biotinylated lectin** (vessels) + **goat anti-PDGFR-β** (pericytes).
  Sudan Black to quench autofluorescence.
- **Mouse pericyte marker:** **CD13**. Human: **PDGFR-β**.
- **Microscopy:** **Leica SP8** confocal, 10× / 20× / 40× objectives. *(No pixel sizes or field
  dimensions are given — see §7.)*
- **Stats:** RStudio; Shapiro–Wilk for normality; two-tailed unpaired one-sample t-test for two
  groups; ANOVA + Tukey HSD for the developmental time course. Mean ± **SD**.
  \*p<0.05, \*\*p<0.01, \*\*\*p<0.001.

## 4. Reported numbers — the reference magnitudes ⭐

**Use these as sanity checks, not targets.** They come from raw confocal data; our panels are
figure-resolution crops.

### 4a. Mouse cortex development (Fig 1D), area fraction / length / branches / distance

| Age | Area fraction | Length (mm/mm²) | Branches (per mm²) | Nearest distance (µm) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **p3** | 0.027 ± 0.003 | 17.12 ± 6.45 | 232.09 ± 92.16 | 50.49 ± 9.50 |
| **p10** | — | — | 423.43 ± 62.37 *(peak)* | — |
| **p120** | 0.106 ± 0.004 | 25.47 ± 0.95 | 310.74 ± 16.29 | 23.72 ± 0.23 |

p-values p3 vs p120: area **p<0.001**, length **p=0.028**, branches **p=0.449** (n.s.),
distance **p<0.001**.

**Biology to remember:** area fraction, length and branch density all rise steeply to ~p30 and
plateau; **branch count peaks at p10 and then *declines*** — the pruning of anastomoses during
normal maturation. Inter-vessel distance halves. So *"more branches" is not monotonically
"more mature"* — a caution for interpreting our own count metric.

### 4b. Mouse peri-infarct, 3 weeks post-photothrombotic stroke (Fig 2C)

| Metric | Intact | Ischemic border zone | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Area fraction | 0.100 ± 0.017 | 0.060 ± 0.014 | **−39%**, p<0.001 |
| Length (mm/mm²) | 57.74 ± 4.83 | 31.89 ± 5.83 | **−44%**, p<0.001 |
| Branches (per mm²) | 396.31 ± 18.81 | 126.57 ± 58.30 | **−68%**, p<0.001 |
| Nearest distance (µm) | 30.34 ± 1.76 | 36.85 ± 3.96 | **+21.4%**, p<0.001 |
| Pericyte coverage | 0.432 ± 0.096 | 0.112 ± 0.056 | **−74%**, p<0.001 |

### 4c. Human medial frontal cortex, AD vs control (Fig 3C)

| Metric | Control | AD | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| Area fraction, grey matter | 0.029 ± 0.001 | 0.026 ± 0.003 | 0.130 (n.s.) |
| Area fraction, white matter | 0.016 ± 0.004 | 0.015 ± 0.003 | 0.554 (n.s.) |
| Pericyte coverage, GM | 0.408 ± 0.110 | 0.149 ± 0.097 | **0.004** (−63%) |
| Pericyte coverage, WM | 0.721 ± 0.231 | 0.256 ± 0.137 | **0.004** (−64%) |

Also: **GM area fraction > WM** (0.028 ± 0.003 vs 0.015 ± 0.003, p<0.001); pericyte coverage
GM vs WM not significant (p=0.078).

> ⚠️ **Direction-of-change warning that matters for us.** In Wang 2022 the *ischemic* rat cortex
> showed **more** gP-CD31 signal than contralateral (24 h post-MCAO), and our pipeline
> reproduces that ranking. Here, mouse peri-infarct at **3 weeks** shows **less** vasculature
> than intact. These are not in conflict — different species, model, and above all **time
> point** (acute endothelial upregulation vs chronic rarefaction). Never state "ischemia ⇒ more
> vessels" as a general rule on the strength of our Wang numbers.

## 5. Imaging / calibration facts for the extracted panels

The paper gives **no pixel sizes**. Everything we can calibrate comes from the printed scale
bars, measured directly off the figure images:

| Panel row | Bar as captioned | Bar measured | µm/px |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fig 1B development, overview | 50 µm | 73 px | 0.685 |
| Fig 1B development, close-up | 50 µm | 71 px | 0.704 |
| Fig 1B adult, overview | 50 µm | 37 px | 1.351 |
| Fig 1B adult, close-up | 50 µm | 51 px | 0.980 |
| Fig 2B overview | 100 µm | **no bar drawn** | **uncalibrated** |
| Fig 2B close-up | 20 µm | 75 px | 0.267 |
| Fig 3B overview | 100 µm | 84 px | 1.190 |
| Fig 3B close-up | 20 µm | 83 px | 0.241 |

These are the numbers in `SCALEBAR_PX` / `SCALEBAR_UM` / `UNCALIBRATED` in
[`analysis/measure_vessels.py`](../../analysis/measure_vessels.py) (the single calibration
source).

**Honest caveats on this table:**
- The bar is drawn **once per row**, in the right-hand column; we apply it to the whole row on
  the assumption that a row is one acquisition scale. The dashed ROI boxes support this for
  Fig 1's adult row (box ≈ 298 px × 1.351 = 403 µm vs a 356 µm close-up field, ~13% apart) but
  only loosely for the development row (~25% apart). **Fig 1's close-up rows are the weakest
  calibration in the set** — the caption states a single 50 µm bar for all of panel B, yet the
  development close-up bar (71 px) implies almost no magnification over its overview (73 px),
  which is hard to reconcile with the visible zoom.
- **Fig 3 is the strongest**: the white ROI square in the overview measures ~101 px → 120 µm,
  against a 105 µm close-up field. Independent agreement within ~14%.
- **Fig 2's overview row draws no bar at all.** It is declared in `UNCALIBRATED` rather than
  given a borrowed scale, so those two panels report area % and pixels only.

---

## 6. Discussion — the arguments worth keeping

- **Why open source.** Most vascular quantification relies on commercial tools (Matlab, Imaris,
  Vesselucida) that are expensive and expertise-heavy; open alternatives are often unmaintained
  or mutually incompatible. This toolbox is free, needs no coding to adapt, and was tested
  across operating systems and ImageJ versions.
- **Why these four parameters.** Area fraction gives general density; **length and branching**
  matter because they govern oxygen/nutrient exchange between capillary and tissue; **distance
  and its variability** detect **local hypoxic regions that a mean density hides**. That last
  argument is the strongest reason for us to add the nearest-neighbour metric.
- **Pericyte coverage came out 40–60%**, where the literature reports ~80%. The authors
  attribute the gap to **different antibodies/epitopes** (CD13 vs PDGFR-β for pericytes; CD31 vs
  lectin/laminin/collagen IV for vessels) — a direct reminder that *marker choice changes the
  number*, which is also why Wang's gP-CD31 vs mM-CD31 comparison matters to us.
- **Sensitivity depends on the staining, not the script.** "The sensitivity and reliability of
  the script strongly depends on the quality of vascular visualization and imaging." Old human
  tissue is heterogeneous — **all automated steps should be manually controlled**. (This is the
  same discipline as our visual-assertion rule.)
- **Retina is denser than brain** — the authors observe higher vascular density in adult mouse
  retina than cortex, consistent with prior reports.
- **Stated limitations.** No information about **vascular integrity / BBB leakage** (would need
  tracers or fibrinogen staining, or MRI/NIRS in humans). Only 5 AD + 5 control subjects, all AD
  female APOE-E4 Braak 5–6 — too small to interpret the phenotype. Structural end-points should
  ideally be paired with physiological imaging (fMRI, PET).

## 7. Supplementary material — every earlier gap now closed ⭐

The owner supplied Supplementary **Data Sheet 1** and **Table 1**, which the Frontiers site had
refused to an automated fetch. They resolve **every** parameter this digest previously listed as
unknown. Files live in [`supplementary/`](supplementary/).

### 7.1 The actual Fiji macro — `supplementary/Quantification.ijm`

Reproduced in full, because it *is* the method:

```javascript
//PRE-PROCESSING
run("Duplicate...", "duplicate");     // keep the raw image
run("8-bit");                          // alternatively 16-bit
//run("Z Project...", "projection=[Max Intensity]");   // if needed
run("Median...", "radius=1");          // remove noise, radius can be adjusted

//BINARIZED IMAGE
//setAutoThreshold("Default dark");
setThreshold(66, 255);
run("Convert to Mask");
run("Analyze Particles...", "size=20-Infinity show=Masks");   // remove small artefacts

//1 Area fraction      -> Set Measurements(area_fraction) + Measure
//2 Vascular length    -> Duplicate, Skeletonize, "Measure Skeleton Length Tool"
//3 Vascular branches  -> Duplicate, Skeletonize, "Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D)", prune=none
//4 Nearest neighbour  -> Analyze Particles(size=20-Infinity, display), then "Nnd"
```

**The parameters that were missing, now known:**

| Previously unknown | Value |
|---|---|
| Bit depth | **8-bit** (16-bit acceptable) |
| Denoise | **Median, radius = 1** |
| Binarization | **manual `setThreshold(66, 255)`** — auto-threshold is present but *commented out*, with `// this should be adapted to your image!!` |
| Small-object removal | **Analyze Particles, size = 20–Infinity** — the image is µm-calibrated, so **20 µm²** |
| Skeleton analysis | **Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D), `prune=none`** |
| Heatmap grid | **15 × 15** squares (`numRow = 15`, "can be adapted to image size") |
| Pixel size | the representative image is **0.6058 µm/px** (§7.3) |

> ⚠️ **The headline caveat, in the authors' own words:** the threshold is **hard-coded and
> manual**, flagged "this should be adapted to your image!!". The published pipeline is therefore
> *not* fully automated at the step that matters most. Our adaptive segmentation is arguably a
> genuine improvement, not a deviation — and it removes the one parameter they could not fix.

### 7.2 The heatmap macro — `supplementary/Heatmap.ijm`

Same pre-processing, then tile the binary into **15 × 15** rectangles, `Measure` the mean of each,
invert it (`255 - mean`) and `Fill` the rectangle with that grey value; finally apply a LUT.
The authors' own LUT is included as `supplementary/hm_stroke.lut`. This is the concrete recipe
behind the recommendation in [`../METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md`](../METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md) §4.4.

### 7.3 `supplementary/Representative_Image.tif` — the best single input we have ⭐

A **1024 × 1024 ImageJ TIFF**, red vessel channel on black, `unit=µm`, `XResolution = 1.650568`
pixels per µm → **0.6058 µm/px**, i.e. a **620 × 620 µm** field.

**Why it matters:** every other panel in this repo is a *figure-resolution crop* re-extracted from
a printed PDF. This one is **native acquisition data, published by the authors, carrying its own
calibration** — no scale bar to measure, no downsampling. It is the image their macro was written
against.

*Calibration cross-check:* capillaries in it measure 8–12 px across = **5–7 µm**, against
Stefanitsch's measured mean CD31⁺ diameter of **6.03 µm**. The metadata is consistent with the
biology, so the 0.6058 µm/px is trustworthy. It is recorded in `UMPP_DIRECT` in
[`../../analysis/measure_vessels.py`](../../analysis/measure_vessels.py) — a separate table from
`SCALEBAR_PX`, because its provenance is image metadata rather than a measured bar.

Cropped into the working dataset as
`figures/panels/VESSEL_rust20suppl_representative.png`.

### 7.4 Running both pipelines on it — the real apples-to-apples ⭐⭐

The authors' recipe (§7.1) reimplemented step-for-step, and our pipeline, on **the same native
image**:

| Metric | **Their recipe, their image** | **Our pipeline, same image** | Agreement | Their *published* adult-cortex value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Area fraction | **9.6%** | 8.1% | **−16%** | 10.6% |
| Length density | **15.3 mm/mm²** | 14.5 mm/mm² | **−5%** | 25.5 mm/mm² |
| Branch count | **1091 /mm²** (420 branches) | 920 /mm² (354 segments) | **−16%** | **311 /mm²** |
| Junctions | 447 /mm² | — | — | — |

**Two conclusions, and the second one corrects this repo's previous diagnosis:**

1. ✅ **Our implementation faithfully reproduces the published method.** Within **5–16%** on all
   three shared metrics, against an independent reimplementation of their macro on their data.
   The residual is our slight *under*-detection (we find less area than their threshold does),
   which is the faint-vessel failure mode — real, but modest.
2. ⚠️ **The "our branch counts are 5–8× too high" conclusion was wrong.** The authors' *own*
   recipe on their *own* representative image yields **1091 branches/mm²** — **3.5× their own
   published 311/mm²**. So the gap is not our fragmentation. It is some combination of the
   representative image being denser than their p120 cortex average, and "number of branches" in
   the published summary meaning something narrower than the raw `Analyze Skeleton` branch count.
   **Whatever the cause, it is theirs, not ours** — and no target derived from that 311 figure
   should be used to judge our segmentation.

### 7.5 Supplementary Table 1 — human post-mortem demographics

| Subject | Braak | CERAD | APOE | Age | Sex | PMD | Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | A | N/A | 90 | M | 07:40 | Non-demented control |
| 2 | 0 | O | E3/E3 | 80 | M | 07:15 | Non-demented control |
| 3 | 0 | B | E3/E3 | 88 | F | 06:15 | Non-demented control |
| 4 | 1 | B | E3/E3 | 69 | F | 15:30 | Non-demented control |
| 5 | 1 | A | E3/E3 | 87 | M | 10:20 | Non-demented control |
| 6 | 5 | C | E3/E4 | 69 | F | 05:45 | Alzheimer's disease |
| 7 | 6 | C | E3/E4 | 89 | F | 04:30 | Alzheimer's disease |
| 8 | 6 | C | E4/E4 | 86 | F | 05:00 | Alzheimer's disease |
| 9 | 6 | C | E3/E4 | 94 | F | 05:40 | Alzheimer's disease |
| 10 | 6 | C | E3/E3 | 91 | F | 03:40 | Alzheimer's disease |

CERAD = amyloid-load score; PMD = post-mortem delay (h:mm). Confirms the paper's stated caveat:
**all five AD subjects are female**, four of five are APOE-E4 carriers, all Braak 5–6, and the
controls skew male — the cohort is too small and too confounded to interpret the phenotype.

### 7.6 Still not obtained

**Supplementary Figures S1, S3, S4** — tip cells/filopodia (S1), retinal development p3–p120 (S3),
HUVEC 3-D in-vitro networks (S4). Not part of Data Sheet 1. Low priority: none is core method,
and S3/S4 are outside brain tissue.

## 8. Extracted images

Three full figures, 24 cropped panels. Descriptions and the working-dataset inventory:
[`figures/README.md`](figures/README.md) and
[`figures/panels/README.md`](figures/panels/README.md).

| File | Fig | Content |
|---|---|---|
| [`figures/fig1_pipeline_development.png`](figures/fig1_pipeline_development.png) | 1 | **The method figure.** A design schematic, B the four visualization methods × development/adult (16 vessel panels), **C the step-by-step pipeline**, D heatmaps p3–p120 + the four quantification plots. |
| [`figures/fig2_stroke_periinfarct.png`](figures/fig2_stroke_periinfarct.png) | 2 | Mouse photothrombotic stroke at 3 weeks: design, intact vs core/ibz vessels, vessels+pericytes close-ups, 5 boxplots. |
| [`figures/fig3_human_alzheimers.png`](figures/fig3_human_alzheimers.png) | 3 | Human AD vs control medial frontal cortex: design, Ctrl vs AD vessels, vessels+pericytes close-ups, GM/WM boxplots. |

**20 of the 24 panels are isolated vessel channel** (`VESSEL_*`) and have been folded into the
working dataset — see [`figures/panels/README.md`](figures/panels/README.md) for the caveats
that come with them (different species, markers and magnifications from the Wang panels; the
per-paper rollup in `measure_vessels.py` exists so the two are never averaged together).

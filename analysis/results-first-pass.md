## Scale calibration (px → µm) — measured from the figures

Each figure prints a **50 µm scale bar** on its merge/montage panel, at the *same resolution* as its
VESSEL panel, so the µm/px transfers directly. Bar widths measured from the images:

| figure(s) | 50 µm bar | **µm/px** | panel field of view |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| fig1 | 61 px | **0.820** | ~301 µm |
| fig3 | 47 px | **1.064** | ~311 µm |
| fig4 / fig5 / fig6 | 76 px | **0.658** | ~228 µm |

**Fig 4/5/6 are zoomed in further** (smaller field) than Fig 1/3. Consequence: raw total length (px
*or* µm) is **not comparable across figures** — a larger field simply contains more vessel. The
comparable metrics are the **scale-invariant densities** below (and area %, which is already a fraction).
Calibration is figure-space; the digest (§5) still recommends recomputing absolute length on raw `.oib`
data, since these are downsampled figure crops.

## What each column is (the professor's three asks)

- **CATEGORIZE** → `cap` / `art`: each branch classified capillary vs penetrating artery by centerline
  diameter (threshold 9 px). `wp90` = 90th-pct diameter.
- **COUNT** → `seg` (raw) and **`cnt_dens`** = segments per mm² (comparable). Segment = junction-to-junction / junction-to-tip piece.
- **MEASURE** → `len_um` (raw, figure-space) and **`len_dens`** = mm of vessel per mm² of tissue (comparable).

## Per-image

| panel | len µm | **len_dens** (mm/mm²) | **cnt_dens** (seg/mm²) | seg | cap | art | area% | wp90 |

| fig6_normal | 772 | 14.8 | 1516 | 79 | 69 | 10 | 6.7 | 10.8 |

## Region means (scale-invariant — the validation target)

| region | **len_dens** (mm/mm²) | **cnt_dens** (seg/mm²) | area% | n |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ischemic | 28.0 | 2064 | 14.2 | 4 |
| penumbra | 27.7 | 2099 | 14.3 | 4 |
| contralateral | 18.1 | 1625 | 10.0 | 4 |
| normal | 17.3 | 1843 | 8.3 | 3 |
| healthy (fig1) | 23.6 | 1951 | 14.2 | 1 |

- **Length density and area %** rank **ischemic ≈ penumbra > contralateral ≈ normal** — matches the
  paper's biology and the visual expectations. This is the trustworthy result.
- **Count density does NOT rank cleanly** (normal comes out spuriously high): fragmentation in the dim
  normal/contralateral fields splits vessels into extra segments, inflating the count. Confirms *count*
  is the metric that still needs the fragmentation fix before it's reliable.

## Known limitations (first pass)

1. **Count is confounded by fragmentation** — short stain dropouts create spurious segments/endpoints,
   worst in dim fields. Next: stronger gap-bridging + segment-level reconnection, then re-check count density.
2. **Artery/capillary split is one diameter threshold** — borderline vessels flip. Note the "normal"
   fields carry higher `wp90` (fig5/fig6 normal contain penetrating arteries), so caliber varies within
   a region more than the region label implies.
3. **Figure-resolution crops** — µm/px is calibrated, but the underlying panels are downsampled from raw
   confocal; recompute absolute length on raw `.oib` for publication numbers.

Regenerate overlays: `python3 analysis/measure_vessels.py --overlays` (writes to `analysis/overlays/`, gitignored).

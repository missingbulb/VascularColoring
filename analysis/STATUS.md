## Where we are — first pass complete

- **Pipeline** (`measure_vessels.py`): red-dominance segmentation → gap-bridge → skeletonize → spur-prune
  → branch graph, producing all three metrics for the 16 `VESSEL_*.png` panels, calibrated to µm from
  the 50 µm scale bars.
- **Overlays** (`annotate_overlays.py`): presentation figures in the agreed outline-over-original style
  (thin, semi-transparent contours; arrows with lengths; artery diameter; scale bar; totals banner).
- **Results** (`results-first-pass.md`): region means for **length density and area %** rank
  **ischemic ≈ penumbra > contralateral ≈ normal** — matching the paper's biology and the visual
  expectations in `expected-results.md`.

## Trustworthy vs. not (be honest about this)

- **Trustworthy:** area %, length density (ranking *and* magnitude), and the µm calibration. All
  three now stand against external references — see the literature section below.
- **Partly trustworthy:** per-segment **COUNT**. It matches a reimplementation of Rust's published
  macro to within 16% on native data, so the *method* is sound; but on figure crops it runs ~2×
  higher, and count density still does not rank cleanly (dim `normal` fields come out spuriously
  high).
- **Not trustworthy:** the **capillary/artery split**. Measured against Stefanitsch's caliber data
  we over-call arteries by ~3×; `ARTERY_DIAM_PX` is a *pixel* constant, so it means a different
  physical diameter on every panel.
- **Also:** absolute length on the figure crops (downsampled, not raw confocal). The one exception
  is `VESSEL_rust20suppl_representative.png` — native resolution with the authors' own calibration.

## Known limitations

1. **Under-detection of faint vessels** in dim fields — visible on the overlays as red vessels with no
   outline (clearest in `fig4_normal` / `contralateral`).
2. **Fragmentation** — stain dropouts split one vessel into several segments, inflating segment/endpoint
   counts and slightly shortening length. Real, but smaller than previously believed (see below).
3. **Caliber split is a single diameter threshold** (`ARTERY_DIAM_PX = 9 px`); borderline vessels flip.
   Worse, the threshold is in **pixels**, so it is a different physical size on every panel.
4. **Figure-resolution crops** — recompute absolute length on raw `.oib` data for publication numbers.
5. **Every scale-dependent constant is in pixels**, not µm, across panels spanning 0.24–1.35 µm/px.

## Literature review done — six papers digested

[`references/`](../references/README.md) now holds a self-contained digest, described figures and
cropped panels for **six** source papers, plus a cross-paper
[`METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md`](../references/METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md). Intake is repeatable via the
`paper-intake` skill. What it changed:

- **The working dataset grew from 16 to 43 panels** (wang-2022 ×16, rust-2020 ×21,
  freitas-andrade-2022 ×6). Three of the six papers contribute no panels — multi-channel merges
  or a different modality — and each digest says so explicitly rather than forcing them in.
- **We now have external ground truth.** Freitas-Andrade Fig 9 prints the authors' own density,
  branching and tortuosity on three images. Our pipeline reproduces their **ranking exactly** and
  agrees on relative counts to **±9%**; the sparse dim panel is our clear worst case. Figures 3,
  8 and 13 add reference masks and skeletons — an answer key that is not our own output.
- **We now match a published method on its own data.** Rust's supplementary material (supplied
  by the owner) contains the exact Fiji macro *and* a µm-calibrated, native-resolution vessel
  image. Reimplementing their recipe and running both on that image:
  **area 9.6% vs our 8.1%, length 15.3 vs 14.5 mm/mm², branches 1091 vs 920 per mm² — agreement
  within 5–16%.** This is the strongest validation the project has.
- **The earlier "our counts are 5–8× too high" conclusion was wrong, and is retracted.** It came
  from comparing figure-crop output against published *summary tables*. The authors' own macro on
  their own image gives **1091 branches/mm², 3.5× their own published 311/mm²** — so the gap
  reproduces without any of our code. Fragmentation is still real (our figure-crop counts run
  ~2× our native-image count), but it is a smaller effect than claimed, and **311/mm² must not be
  used as an acceptance target.**
- **CATEGORIZE now has an external anchor, and it says our threshold is wrong.** Stefanitsch
  measures mean CD31⁺ vessel diameter at 6.03 µm and mean ASMA⁺ artery diameter at 22.9 µm. Our
  `ARTERY_DIAM_PX = 9` works out to **5.9 µm** on the fig4/5/6 panels — at the mean of *all*
  vessels, so ordinary capillaries are being called arteries. Measured on Rust's calibrated
  native image, we call **29% of segments arteries** where Stefanitsch finds only **10%** of
  vessels above 10 µm — over-calling by ~3×.

## Next step (recommended, supersedes the earlier plan)

The earlier agreed step — improve segmentation sensitivity and reconnect fragments — still stands
and is still the main event. The review adds a cheaper prerequisite and sharper acceptance tests:

1. **First, put the scale-dependent constants in µm.** `σ=1.0`, `min_len=8`, `<20 px`, `disk(2)`
   and `ARTERY_DIAM_PX=9` are all pixel constants applied across panels spanning 0.24–1.35 µm/px,
   so each means something different per figure. `umpp_for()` already exists. Small change; it is
   what makes every comparison below meaningful.
2. **Then the segmentation work**, judged by three tests instead of one: (a) the un-outlined
   vessels get captured on the overlay view; (b) **we stay within ~15% of the reimplemented Rust
   macro on `VESSEL_rust20suppl_representative.png`** — the honest acceptance target, replacing
   the retracted "few hundred per mm²"; (c) our mask and skeleton on the Freitas-Andrade
   originals look like their published mask and skeleton.

   Note the direction of the residual: on native data we find **16% less** area than their
   threshold does. **We under-detect, we do not over-detect** — so sensitivity, not
   over-segmentation, is the thing to push on.
3. **Fix the caliber threshold** using Stefanitsch's published bins (<5 / 5–10 / >10 µm), and
   consider reporting the three-bin distribution rather than a binary split. Still worth the
   external check against Wang's phalloidin / α-SMA panels.

Rust's supplementary toolbox — the macro, the heatmap script (15 × 15 squares) and their LUT —
is in [`references/rust-2020-fiji-vascular-analysis/supplementary/`](../references/rust-2020-fiji-vascular-analysis/supplementary/),
so the published parameters (median radius 1, `setThreshold(66,255)`, particles ≥ 20 µm²,
`prune=none`) no longer have to be guessed at.

Further candidates, with rationale, in [`METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md`](../references/METHODS-SYNTHESIS.md) §4:
nearest-neighbour distance (fragmentation-immune, so trustworthy while count is not), a grid
heatmap of per-square area fraction (two papers converge on it; answers *where* tissue is
under-vascularized), and the published segmentation choices (adaptive local threshold, median
filter, iterative smallest-first pruning).
